                <h3>Hiking</h3>
                <p>I spent my days hiking through lush trails. One of the easiest and most beautiful hiking trails in Vail is the Gore Valley Trail. 
                   Beautiful paved path popular for walking and biking with great mountain, aspen trees, and stream views. The entire trail is 12 miles long and spans from East Valley Trail on the western end and the Val Pass Trail on the eastern end.

                <h3>Biking</h3>
                <p>Biking was another highlight of my trip. Vail has an extensive network of trails catering to all skill levels. I rented a mountain bike and tackled some exhilarating paths that wound through dense forests and meadows bursting with wildflowers.
                   One of the most memorable experiences was taking a lift up to the top of the mountain. The ride itself was awe-inspiring, as I ascended over the treetops, soaking in the expansive views. At the summit, I felt on top of the world, with endless vistas stretching out in every direction.
